# **Skins.json file for Skins by misticos on Umod**

This is **unoffically** allowed as stated in the support category https://umod.org/community/skins/5923-adding-all-approved-skins
But I sat there for a week including late nights till 3-4am building this collection siving through RustLabs skins inputting data one by so I'm keeping this updated every week! 

Notes:
- Hazmat Skins are not all there I cannot for the life of me find the correct Item ID's, so only the spacesuit is there.
- Some older skins do not work correctly they sit with the blue 360 arrow and do not load, they are the correct ID's they just do not work
- Some clothing skins don't actually have ID's so they were not added If i recall its the free drop jackets and T-shirts some of them don't have workshop ID's
